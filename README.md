Book Recommendation System | Machine Learning Project
📌 Project Overview
Developed a hybrid book recommendation system combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized book suggestions. The system analyzes user preferences and book metadata to generate accurate recommendations, improving user engagement and discovery of new books.

🔍 Key Features
✔ Hybrid Recommendation Model – Combines user-item interactions (collaborative) and book features (content-based)
✔ Data Processing – Cleaned and analyzed 100,000+ book ratings from Goodreads dataset


🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Machine Learning (Cosine Similarity)

Frontend (html,css)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

🚀 Impact & Applications
Personalized suggestions for readers based on past ratings and similar users

Scalable architecture adaptable to e-commerce and digital bookstores


🎯 Why This Project?
This system demonstrates end-to-end machine learning pipeline skills—from data cleaning and feature engineering to model deployment. It solves a real-world problem by helping users discover books they’ll love, making it ideal for showcasing ML, data analysis, and full-stack development abilities.
